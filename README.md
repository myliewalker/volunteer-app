# Karen volunteer app challenge


Hi! I’m Karen and I’m running for office in the great state of MI. I’d really like your help. I need a way to have my volunteers sign up to help me out.
In particular I need them to be able to give me their first name, last name, middle initial, and date of birth. I also need to know what they are interested in.
Then I need to match them with the voter data that I have. The format of the voter data will be name, age, location, phone number, and date last contacted.
Can you help me with that?

Note you can do this either in Python, Java, Javascript, or Golang.

## FAQ

Q: What database/schema should I use?

Please feel free to use whatever data models that you need to for the database.
You may use any open source database you like or none at all.
However remember if you include a database you should include references for how to install that database in your readme.
You should also include instructions on how to get the schema for the database up to date.


## Notes

Please include clear instructions on how to use the software you create.
This includes things like calling out what dependencies are required to run the software.
Instructions or scripts on setting up the development environment.
Explanation of the any relevant software architecture decisions.
[Here](https://github.com/iharsh234/WebApp) is an example of a good readme.

Also note this is pretty open ended question.
There aren't any right or wrong answers.
Tuesday Strategies would just like to see how you would solve a problem similar to problems you might encounter in your day to day work.
Please don't feel that you need to spend more than a few hours on this.
You should focus your time on what you think is most interesting.
If you like the front-end then make a pretty front-end.
If you like the back-end then focus on the back-end.

Please do make it so that anyone can use the software (no terminal only applications).

Finally have fun with the question and add whatever you would like and show us some creativity.
